# World Highlighter
*No longer supported, if you'd like to take ownership of the plugin send me a message in the RL dev channel so that they are aware and it can be trasnfered*
Adds a rightclick option to player chat messages which will scroll and highlight their world, assuming you aren't on the same world.
